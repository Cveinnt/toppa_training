# Project

### Write a html based website about yourself.

Step 1: Create a folder for all the files and create an index.html file in it.

Step 2: Start filling in details about yourself: your name, school, fun facts, short bio, etc. **Please** use **heading** tags to emphasize those information. You are welcome to use the <div> tag as well.

Step 3: Put your resume in the folder and add a hyperlink to your resume!

Step 4: The website still looks pretty boring, why don't you add some colors to the texts?

Step 5: Add an image so people know you're not a bot! (You can upload any image you want, but preferably about yourself).

Step 6: Write a short paragraph (1 - 3 sentences) about yourself. 

### When you're done, please submit your folder to the Toppa Web Dev folder.

### Optional:

- Add a table to your website
- Try using CSS to further decorate your website
- Skip everything and invent typescript
