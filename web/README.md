# Description
This repo contains all the training materials for Toppa's web team training.  

# About
Toppa @ Berkeley is an initiative that started at Google, to combat cultural issues often encouraged by professionals of East Asian descent and leading to the phenomenon known as Bamboo Ceiling. Toppa @ Berkeley started in Spring 2019, and has the support of the Berkeley College of Engineering and Google.  
As a director, I have created the following websites for Toppa:
- [https://toppa.berkeley.edu](https://toppa.berkeley.edu)
- [https://dsc-berkeley.appspot.com](https://dsc-berkeley.appspot.com/) . 

Through training, the web team is expected to maintain and refurbish these websites.
