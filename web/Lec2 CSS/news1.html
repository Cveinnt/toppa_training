    The Republican Party is a shamefully divided party. It has, in addition to Hillary Clinton and President Donald Trump, many of the rank-and-file types that hated each other and sold their souls for a couple of decades. And it has been lurching ever deeper into the right, aided by that party’s most seductive demographic tool: resentment.
    <br>

    <br>
    The future of the GOP depends on whether this dominance can be sustained, and the critical question here is this: Why has the party become so unpopular, despite being pretty powerful. If not Donald Trump, then what?
    <br>

    <br>
    It’s not an easy question to answer. Whatever the latest polls say, the electorate is far less friendly to the GOP than it used to be, and that’s a fact that has been apparent for many years. In 2015, Gallup had no real choice between Republican and Democratic candidates. According to the polling agency, if the election had been held that year, Clinton would have won by more than 3 million votes. According to some of the same measurements, that result might have been possible in 1992.
    <br>

    <br>
    Perhaps this overstatement is wrong, but I have trouble seeing it. An institution that often tries to convince the public that it is composed of various fair-minded constituencies is more likely to sound like the party that controls Congress, which will have to deal with Republican intransigence no matter what comes out of the White House.
    <br>

    <br>
    Why?
    <br>

    <br>
    First, many people still see the party as similar to the one that gave them everything. Yes, there have been some hard-right factions that have been willing to trample on norms, but the general mood is still more “reliable Republican” than “repulsive RINO.”
    <br>

    <br>
    Second, it’s not just the issue of immigration that turns people against the party. It’s also its failure to stand up to Trump. That the president is, for instance, making whole swathes of the party suspicious of women is, to put it mildly, not going to endear Republicans to women voters. But as long as Republicans have not been willing to stand up to Trump, he will remain the party’s standard-bearer.
    <br>

    <br>
    Third, the sort of politics that Republicans used to employ is fast becoming the establishment politics of the left, in any case, with former Clinton advisors lining up to praise some of the latest Democratic candidates.
    <br>

    <br>
    And fourth, Republicans have become more and more dominated by white Americans, and this is no longer their party. “It could not have been farther from then, when there was a vibrant minority Democratic party,” writes Bob Shelton, a party historian, in the current issue of the American Prospect. “First and foremost, the party needed — even needed — the support of black Americans.”
    <br>

    <br>
    Demographics matter, and most of the white Americans who are the angry whites that Republicans attract have grown less and less white over time. (The same is true of suburban white Americans.) The Republicans now make the opposite of a good recovery. They make a bad recovery worse, and they’ve never experienced an economic boom, despite having control of all levers of power.
    <br>

    <br>
    All of this means that, as Ron Brownstein, who wrote a terrific article on the matter, puts it, “the next presidential contest is shaping up as a toss-up between Democrats, who must rely on core support among younger and first-time voters, and Republicans, who will have to worry about attracting voters without immediate family ties to a dwindling racial majority.” That means that, even if the GOP remains in power for quite a while, the party could soon be facing demographic fragmentation as well as future challenges from the left.
    <br>

    <br>
    All of this has the potential to be great for democracy, as Chris Cillizza recently argued. He is particularly encouraged by a growing number of center-left politicians who recognize the danger that both Trump and the GOP have created. (Of course, neither Democrats nor Republicans have yet come to grips with the fact that working together is a better policy bet than one based on divisions.) But if the Republicans continue to work to solidify their power base, while the Democrat-base continues to expand, we could see a greatly diminished democracy, both at the state and national levels.
