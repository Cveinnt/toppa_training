  <center class="title">Is Trump a Pathological Narcissist?</center>

    Does Donald Trump live a tiny little ego complex? His manic inflamed bulldog behavior at times recalls a Shakespearean actor pushing a button to berate the actor next to him. Still, nobody can deny that Trump, unlike more prudent politicians, loves to ramble, tell wild stories and rant against his foes and the media.

    <br>
    Is he a narcissist? Is he so narcissistic that he actually has no other emotions than wanting to tell people how small he is? Psychologists at Harvard Medical School and Purdue University, among others, have attempted to answer those questions.
    <br>

    <br>
    Their reviews, published in the May issues of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, attempt to establish whether being more emotionally stable is a good measure of a person’s psychological health. They also explore the limits of the definitions of narcissism, what they would call neuroticism — which is the proportion of a person’s behavior indicating a low level of emotions — and narcissism itself.
    <br>

    <br>
    In a 2013 meta-analysis of the literature, the authors of the newest meta-analysis, Benoit Magimel of Yale University and Yale University’s Christina Low of Purdue University, found most studies were inconsistent and often misreported whether people were narcissists or had narcissistic personality traits. They also found that symptoms of narcissism sometimes had no relation to a person’s ability to function in modern life.

    <br>
    The most common narcissism studies were based on interviews and surveys of college-aged students in the U.S. and Australia and by 40 psychiatrists in the U.S. They wanted to address the questions, what researchers call the implications of the study.
    <br>

    <br>
    In what they called the latest meta-study, Magimel and Low examined 14 literature reviews, including 10 from which interviews were obtained and three covering the same people, but with no objective and lengthy questionnaires.
    <br>

    <br>
    And they found the most striking finding, some of the most highly regarded studies, “determined that out of all the personality traits, narcissism had the strongest association with high scores on other personality traits.” They also found the most dramatic increases in narcissism in society came when traits such as neuroticism levels were low.
    <br>

    <br>
    “Other personality traits, however, are not important indicators of narcissism either in scope or in its relevance to the study of psychology,” they wrote. And the fact that the findings in any particular study “may not mean much in the aggregate suggests that individuals with high narcissism, even if they are highly emotionally stable, may still behave unpredictably,” Magimel said.
    <br>

    <br>
    When it comes to what other personalities such as psychopathy or Machiavellianism, the researchers found that it had even stronger relation to being a narcissist than to a decreased emotional stability.
    <br>

    <br>
    Why? Magimel and Low speculated that narcissism might be a result of one of two underlying conditions: maladaptive or abnormal narcissistic behavior or a disorder called borderline or narcissistic personality syndrome.
    <br>

    <br>
    In a previous study of patients referred by the Massachusetts General Hospital’s psychopathology department to a psychiatrist for assessment for the treatment of the diseases narcissism, psychology professor Steven Hall of the hospital found narcissistic personality disorder to be more prevalent than he expected.
    <br>

    <br>
    Another study, published in the May issue of the journal Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, evaluated a group of people who were hospitalized for psychotic disorders. It found that only one out of 6 patients who met diagnostic criteria for narcissism and narcissistic personality disorder had been treated for either disorder at the start of the study and treatment had not begun. These patients were also considered more socially isolated than other patients.
    <br>

    <br>
    Ezra Klein, a columnist and senior fellow at the Washington Post, thinks the study points to a larger problem.
    <br>

    <br>
    “We live in a world where a narcissist is a widely accepted political and professional success story,” he writes. “I’m not suggesting we eliminate that culture — I mean, Trump is so hyper-competitive and good at deal-making that he may be an unsinkable ship. But it seems to me we can do something to help people move away from it.”
