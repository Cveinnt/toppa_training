# Description
This repository contains the training materials for Toppa @ Berkeley's data analytics team.
Data used in this repository are all open source - some are from Toppa's past surveys.

# About
Toppa @ Berkeley is an initiative that started at Google, to combat cultural issues often encouraged by professionals of East Asian descent and leading to the phenomenon known as Bamboo Ceiling. Toppa @ Berkeley started in Spring 2019, and has the support of the Berkeley College of Engineering and Google. 

As an experimental project, the data team is responsible for marketing analytics to provide better marketing advice and to increase audience growth through data analytics.

# Topics 

Lecture 1:    
Basic visualization, identification of outliers, and regressions.   

Lecture 2:  
Text preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Bias Variance Tradeoff, Regularization.  
Materials used for lecture 2 are taken from Berkeley's course Data 100.  

Lecture 3:
Regularization extension, Gradient Descent, Classification, Logistic Regression, Log Loss, Cross Entropy loss, and Accuracy/Error/Precision/Recall/ROC/AUC. Materials used are taken from Berkeley's Data 100.

HW1:   
Basic visualization and preprocessing, and the basics of OLS/Ridge Regression with sklearn.  

HW2:  
Homework 2 covers an intro to Regex, Feature Engineering, and Text Preprocessing.
It also have a basic tutorial on classifying Russian Troll tweets with Naive Bayes.

HW3:
Homework 3 reviews what we've learned so far: it includes EDA (exploratory data analysis), feature engineering/preprocessing, and Model building. It includes a typical classification task with LGBM/XGBOOST/Logistic Regression. Specifically, we are using Avazu's CTR dataset to do CTR prediction.
